# TurboTerm
A bash shell utility to make the terminal easier to use and more powerful.  

This utility will work on Linux, MacOS, and we expect that it will work on Windows 10.

## Install
To install, simply copy the .bashrc file into /home/username

Until we have a full blown installer this will overwrite your existing .bashrc file. 

It won't casue any damage, but it will over ride any previous customizations.
