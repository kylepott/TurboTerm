# TurboTerm
A bash shell utility to make the terminal easier to use and more powerful.  

This utility will work on Linux, MacOS, and we expect that it will work on Windows 10.  Please note that it is untested on Mac and Windows.

# Install

1. Open your favorite text editor and append the following lines to ~/.bashrc.
Alternatively, in a terminal you can type nano ~/.bashrc and paste the following at the end of the file.

if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then

source ~/.TurboTerm

fi


2. Copy ~.TurboTerm into your home folder.

3. There is no step three.  Fire up your terminal and enjoy!
